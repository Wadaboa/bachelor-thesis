# Bachelor's degree thesis
This repository contains a `LaTeX` project which summarizes the work that went into the refinement of a Python library to perform OCR on identity documents.
The [PDF thesis](thesis.pdf) is subdivided into 4 chapters:
1. `Math prerequisites`, where I explain some basic image processing/computer vision related mathematical concepts
2. `Image binarization`, where I depict the core of what I produced during my curricular internship
3. `Image matching`, where I show some applications of feature detectors and feature matchers on the problem at hand
4. `Text detection`, where I describe some solutions to identify the location of non-standard text in identity documents

Each chapter starts with a theoretical introduction and then shifts to the practical approach, which is accompained by figures and pseudo-code algorithms.
